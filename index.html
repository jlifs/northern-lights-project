    <h2>What causes this phenomenon?</h2>
    <h3>Aurora Borealis</h3>
    <p>
        The Northern Lights, also known 
        as the aurora borealis, are a 
        natural light display in the 
        night sky, primarily visible 
        near Earth's magnetic poles. 
        They occur when charged particles 
        from the sun collide with the 
        Earth's atmosphere, causing the 
        gases to glow in various colors.

            <h4>Tromsø, Norway</h4>
            <p>
                Tromsø, Norway is a prime location for seeing 
                the Northern Lights due to its geographical 
                position within the Northern Lights oval. The 
                city is situated directly below this oval, 
                a continuous ring of auroral activity, 
                making it a hotspot for witnessing the lights. 
            </p>
              <h5>Best time</h5>
              <p>
                From late August to early April, with peak 
                visibility between December and February during the 
                Polar Night when the city is shrouded in almost 
                continuous darkness. 
            </p>
            <h5>Tip</h5>
            <p>
                To maximize your chances, stay in Tromsø for at 
                least 3-5 days, as weather conditions can change.

      <h4>Blue Lagoon, Iceland</h4>
      <p>
        The Blue Lagoon's location, away from the city, 
        offers a good chance of spotting the aurora because 
        it's less affected by light pollution than areas 
        closer to Reykjavik. 
      </p>
      <h5>Best time</h5>
      <p>
        Generally between September and April, especially 
        during the darker months of November to January and 
        around the equinoxes in September and March. This is 
        because the long, dark nights of winter provide the 
        best conditions for viewing. 
    </p>
      <h5>Tip</h5>
      <p>
        It's recommended that you spend at least 7 nights in 
        the country for the greatest odds.

      <h4>Fairbanks, Alaska</h4>
      <p>
        Fairbanks is a prime location to witness the 
        Northern Lights due to its ideal location within 
        the Auroral Oval. Additionally, its low light 
        pollution and relatively clear night skies create 
        optimal viewing conditions.
      </p>
      <h5>Best time</h5>
      <p>
        Aurora Season in Fairbanks runs from August 21st 
        to April 21st between 10:30 p.m. and 2:00 a.m.
    </p>
      <h5>Tip</h5>
      <p>
        Fairbanks is prone to unpredictable weather, 
        and clear skies are essential for seeing the 
        lights. Staying for at least 3-4 nights increases 
        your likelihood of having at least one clear night.
